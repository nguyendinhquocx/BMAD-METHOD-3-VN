## Infrastructure Verification

### Validation Framework

Infrastructure architecture này sẽ được validated sử dụng comprehensive `infrastructure-checklist.md`, với particular focus trên Section 12: Architecture Documentation Validation. Checklist ensures:

- Completeness của architecture documentation
- Consistency với broader system architecture
- Appropriate level của detail cho different stakeholders
- Clear implementation guidance
- Future evolution considerations

### Validation Process

Architecture documentation validation nên được performed:

- Sau initial architecture development
- Sau significant architecture changes
- Trước major implementation phases
- Trong periodic architecture reviews

Platform Engineer nên sử dụng infrastructure checklist để systematically validate tất cả aspects của architecture document này.
