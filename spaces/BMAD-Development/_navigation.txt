## 🚀 How to Get Started in Development Space

### Step 1: Assess Your Architecture Input
```
✅ Prerequisites from Architecture Phase:
├── Complete system architecture specifications
├── Frontend architecture với component design
├── Infrastructure architecture với deployment strategy
├── Finalized technology stack với specific versions
├── Implementation guidance optimized cho AI agents
└── Quality validation reports với approval
```

### Step 2: Choose Your Development Approach
```
💻 Choose based on project characteristics:
├── Standard Agile Development → 2-week sprints với comprehensive process
├── Rapid Development (4-6 weeks) → Simple apps với experienced team
├── Research-Heavy Development (12-16 weeks) → Complex/innovative features
├── Legacy Integration (8-12 weeks) → Significant legacy system integration
└── Custom Development Approach → Tailored to specific project needs
```

### Step 3: Engage Development Team
