## 🚀 How to Get Started in Architecture Space

### Step 1: Assess Your Input Materials
```
✅ Prerequisites from Planning Phase:
├── Complete validated PRD document
├── User personas và journey maps  
├── Market research và competitive analysis
├── Technical constraints documentation
├── Epic breakdown với feature priorities
└── Success metrics và acceptance criteria
```

### Step 2: Choose Your Architecture Approach
```
🏗️ Choose based on project complexity:
├── Standard Architecture (4 weeks) → Most common approach
├── Fast-Track Architecture (2 weeks) → Simple apps với known patterns
├── Research-Heavy Architecture (6 weeks) → Complex/novel technical challenges
├── Legacy Integration (4-5 weeks) → Significant legacy system integration
└── Custom Approach → Tailored to specific project needs
```

### Step 3: Engage Architecture Specialists
- **System Architecture Focus**: Start với Architect (Fred) cho overall technical design
- **Frontend/UX Focus**: Engage Design Architect (Jane) cho UI/UX implementation
- **Infrastructure Focus**: Work với Platform Engineer (Alex) cho cloud architecture
- **Comprehensive Approach**: Coordinate all three architects cho integrated solution
