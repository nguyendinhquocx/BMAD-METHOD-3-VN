## 🚀 How to Get Started in Operations Space

### Step 1: Identify Your Deployment Stage
```
❓ What describes your current state?
├── First production deployment → Use Initial Deployment workflow
├── Feature deployment → Use Feature Release workflow  
├── Infrastructure changes → Use Infrastructure Update workflow
├── Performance issues → Use Performance Optimization workflow
├── Security updates → Use Security Patch workflow
└── Incident response → Use Incident Management workflow
```

### Step 2: Choose Your Operational Focus
- **For New Deployments**: Setup complete CI/CD pipeline và monitoring
- **For Updates**: Use blue-green hoặc canary deployment strategies
- **For Maintenance**: Focus on monitoring, alerting, và performance optimization
- **For Scaling**: Implement auto-scaling và load balancing strategies

### Step 3: Follow DevOps Best Practices
1. **Infrastructure as Code**: All infrastructure defined in version control
2. **Automated Testing**: Comprehensive testing in CI/CD pipeline  
3. **Monitoring**: Full observability với metrics, logs, và tracing
4. **Security**: Security scanning, vulnerability management, compliance
5. **Incident Response**: Runbooks, alerting, và post-mortem processes
